# Koii Task Development Template

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive template and starter kit for developing decentralized tasks on the Koii Network. It provides a robust, batteries-included framework for blockchain developers to quickly bootstrap and deploy distributed computing tasks with built-in consensus and incentive mechanisms.

### 🌟 Key Features

- **Complete Task Development Lifecycle**: Full support from task creation to deployment
- **Modular Architecture**: Separate modules for task logic, submission, auditing, and distribution
- **Development Tools Included**:
  - ESLint for code quality
  - Prettier for consistent formatting
  - Jest for testing
  - Webpack for bundling
  - Docker support
- **Simplified Task Management**: Easy-to-understand structure for defining task behaviors
- **Production-Ready Configuration**: Environment-specific settings and deployment scripts

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version >=20.0.0, LTS Versions)
- **Yarn** package manager
- _(Optional)_ Docker Compose

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/koii-network/task-template.git your-task-project
   cd your-task-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Copy environment configuration:
   ```bash
   cp .env.developer.example .env
   ```

4. Run initial tests:
   ```bash
   yarn test
   ```

## 🛠 Customization Guide

### Core Task Logic

The primary files you'll modify are in the `src/task/` directory:

- `1-task.js`: Main task implementation
- `0-setup.js`: One-time initialization logic
- `2-submission.js`: Proof submission strategy
- `3-audit.js`: Work verification logic
- `4-distribution.js`: Reward distribution mechanism

### Configuration

Customize your task by editing:
- `config-task.yml`: Task metadata and deployment settings
- `.env` files: Environment-specific configurations
